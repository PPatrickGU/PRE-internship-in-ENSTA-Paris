Unreal Engine is also used to create the data.

Different from the creation of ocean in Blender (toturials here: [[link:]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfi7HW8qHAo&t=227s)), creation of ocean in UE4 (Unreal Engine) is much more complex. The free ocean materials can't give us a perfect form of waves and the buoyancy effect. 

The sea model mention before has well simulated nearly all the physical conditions of ocean. And with the correspondant tutorial, [[link]]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEUoAlZz-zo&feature=youtu.be) and  [[link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQ9QSJfQsg&feature=youtu.be), we can easily use this model and create a boat floating on the sea. It's really a good model and it can help us a lot.
