# wave-simulator

Main part of the work placed in [reposetory](https://github.com/manubatet/Ship-simulator).

Take into account that it is not directly executed by python, it is executed by Blender. So instalation is needed.


# INSTALATION

# HOW TO INSTALL BLENDER (LINUX)
(full version https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Building_Blender/Linux/Ubuntu)

## 1 Get the source

    mkdir ~/blender-git
    cd ~/blender-git
    git clone https://git.blender.org/blender.git
    cd blender
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    git submodule foreach git checkout master
    git submodule foreach git pull --rebase origin master

- ### 1.1 If you want update Blender's source code to the latest development version. So in ~/blender-git/blender/

    make update
## 2. Install/Update the dependencies
  - ### 2.1 Recommended to use install_deps.sh script. To use it you are only required to install the following dependencies:

        git, build-essential
        for git: sudo apt-get install git
        for build-essential: sudo apt-get install build-essential

  - ### 2.2 Then, get the sources and run install_deps.sh

        cd ~/blender-git
        ./blender/build_files/build_environment/install_deps.sh

## 3. Compile Blender with CMake
  - ### 3.1 Installing CMake

         sudo apt-get -y install cmake

  - ### 3.2 Automatic CMake Setup

        cd ~/blender-git/blender
        make

    - #### Once the build finishes you'll get a message like..

          Blender successfully built, run from: /home/me/blender-git/build_linux/bin/blender

  - ### 3.3 Updating your local checkout and rebuilding is as simple as:

         cd ~/blender-git/blender
         make update
         make    

 # FINISH

 ### BUT if you want Edit CMake Parameters go to https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Building_Blender/Linux/Ubuntu


# To run the script from terminal
(more info: https://learnsharewithdp.wordpress.com/2018/08/27/how-to-run-a-python-script-in-blender/)

    blender filename.blend --python script.py in our case
    blender ocean_render_2.blend --python 4macro.py

# Files
## parameters.py
Here you have all the parameters that the macro is goingo to import. You can select to iterate between several parameters. Those parameters are only choppiness, wave scale, wind velocity and random seed. Is not very difficult to add more parameters but those are the parameters that are more important to change the simulation. Here: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/modeling/modifiers/simulate/ocean.html you can find what does each parameter exactly do related to the ocean creation. The parameters about the render are clearly explained in the code.

## macro.py
This is the macro. Theorically you will not need to change anything from here but there are some explanations inside about what the code does and I encourage you to improve the code and add more functions.

# Data

Render 2 frames per second. This is the best option so that the differences between two frames are noticeable and they do not "duplicate" the information.
